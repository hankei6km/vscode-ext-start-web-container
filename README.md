# Start WebContainer

Start [WebContainer](https://webcontainers.io/), and use Jsh and Preview URL.

This extension dynamically generates an external tab with Cross Origin isolation enabled using [Nodebox](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/advanced-usage/nodebox)(the `Server` tab in the figure below). Therefore, the [`?vscode-coi=on`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/137884) parameter is not required in VS Code for the Web.
